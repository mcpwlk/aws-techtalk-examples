<h1>Packer and Terraform usage examples</h1>

    <p>
    The purpose of the following code examples and demos is to introduce the
    reader to the basic usage of
    <a href="https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html">Packer</a> and
    <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">Terraform</a>
    by deploying an example, real (sort of, at least...) service in AWS.
    </p>

    <p>
    The full, final Packer and Terraform configuration can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples">here</a>.
    In particular, note that some demos (the <i>*.cast</i> files available
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/master/docs">here</a>)
    might be hard to watch in a browser due to the JS player limitations.
    In which case, they can be downloaded and played with <a
    href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema#quick-intro">asciinema offline player</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The objective of the below demonstration is to deploy a service which will
    serve nginx default page.

<h2 id="packer">Using Packer</h2>

    First, we build an AWS AMI, using Packer. We use an official Ubuntu AMI,
    provided by Canonical, and install nginx in the provisioning step.

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/blob/00-packer/packer/packer.json">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="00-packer-execution.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h2 id="terraform">Using Terraform</h2>

    <p>
    Before writing Terraform config for the actual service, let's get
    acquainted with basic usage of the tool.
    </p>

<h3 id="terraform-1">Basic usage flow</h3>

    <p>
    A common flow for a user to introduce any changes into the
    infrastructure managed by Terraform is to clone the config repository, make
    the changes in the config, initialize Terraform, and run <i>plan</i> and
    <i>apply</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/01-tf-basic-flow/terraform">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="01-terraform-basic-usage.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h4 id="terraform-2">Destroying infra</h4>

    <p>
    A slightly less common use case is to <i>destroy</i> either the whole
    infrastructure or some of its elements.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that selective destruction is out of scope of these examples.
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="02-terraform-basic-destroy.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h3 id="terraform-3">Deploying a service</h3>

    <p>
    Now, after getting acquainted with the basic usage, let's proceed with
    preparing the nginx default page service.
    </p>

<h4 id="terraform-4">Basic infra</h4>

    <p>
    The new code contains the EC2 (the AWS virtual instance) definition as well
    as entries for private network entities which will be used as the network
    context for the new instance.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note the multiple files in this example. Terraform collects and uses all
    files in a current directory which end with <i>.tf</i>, which gives a
    freedom in splitting up the service configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/02-tf-minimal-infra/terraform">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="03-terraform-minimal-infra.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h4 id="terraform-5">Adding EIP</h4>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, the infrastucture created in the previous step lacks any
    public endpoint. Let's fix this by adding an EIP (AWS Elastic IP)
    definition and reapplying.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/03-tf-eip/terraform">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/compare/02-tf-minimal-infra...03-tf-eip">Comparison with previous version.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="04-terraform-add-eip.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h4 id="terraform-6">Outputting values</h4>

    <p>
    The EIP has been created in the previous example, but we don't have any
    immediate way of knowing it. As an alternative of logging in to AWS Console
    to check what it is, we can add an output definition.
    </p>

    <p>
    This time, the infrastructure doesn't change, so we just need to
    <i>refresh</i> the Terraform state to obtain the IP.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/04-tf-outputs/terraform">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/compare/03-tf-eip...04-tf-outputs">Comparison with previous version.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="05-terraform-output-eip.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h4 id="terraform-7">Variables</h4>

    <p>
    Before the next step, which would be the introduction of multiple instances
    of our nginx default page endpoints, we need to do some softcoding of the
    values used in the config. Terraform provides <i>variable</i> config items
    for this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/05-tf-variables/terraform">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/compare/04-tf-outputs...05-tf-variables">Comparison with previous version.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    No demo, since functionally nothing changes.
    </p>

<h4 id="terraform-8">Looping</h4>

    <p>
    Now it's time for multiple nginx-default-page instances! Terraform allows
    creating multiple instances of an object by providing <i>count</i>
    metaparameter.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that lots of things are changing when running <i>apply</i>. Terraform
    is able to detect that for instance the existing subnet doesn't have to be
    recreated, however that's not the case with the existing instance, which is
    created anew. This could be mitigated by manually adjusting the terraform
    state, however that's out of scope of this demonstration.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/tree/06-tf-loops/terraform">Code.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/mcpwlk/aws-techtalk-examples/compare/05-tf-variables...06-tf-loops">Comparison with previous version.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Demo:
    <p>

    <asciinema-player cols=105 rows=28 theme="tango" idle-time-limit=1 src="06-terraform-looped-res.cast"></asciinema-player>

<h4 id="terraform-9">Modularization</h4>

    <p>
    The last step is to modularize the network configuration, which can be then
    reused for other, more serious services.
    </p>

    <p>
    Superficially, a lot has changed since the last example, however note that
    this is mostly due to moving <i>vpc.tf</i> to
    <i>modules/basic-vpc/main.tf</i>. The biggest conceptual change is to
    encapsulate the VPC objects and provide the input and output definitions
    for the module (with <i>modules/basic-vpc/variables.tf</i> and
    <i>modules/basic-vpc/outputs.tf</i>, respectively).
    </p>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, Terraform will destroy and recreate almost everything in
    this case. Again, in real life this could be prevented by tinkering with
    the Terraform state.
